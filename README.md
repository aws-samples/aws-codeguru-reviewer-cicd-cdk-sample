# CDK TypeScript project to set up the CodeGuru Reviewer CI/CD integration

This repo contains a CDK Stack that sets up [CodeGuru Reviewer GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/codeguru-reviewer) in your AWS account for CI/CD integration in GitHub. It sets up the correct permissions for using CodeGuru Reviewer as well as creating an S3 bucket that holds the code and build artifacts for analysis by CodeGuru Reivewer.

## Before we get started

If you do not have the CDK for TypeScript installed, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html) and make sure your credentials are [set up correctly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with.html) so you can deploy with CDK. The steps include:

```
npm install typescript aws-cdk
```

Once everything is set up correctly, fetch the dependencies and compile:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Specify which organizations can use CodeGuru Reviewer

In the file [`./cdk.json`](cdk.json), add all GitHub repositories that should be allowed to use CodeGuru Reviewer in the `allowedGithubRepos` list. For example:
```
"allowedGithubRepos": ["aws-samples/*", "awslabs/smithy"]
```
allows all repositories in the organization `aws-sample` and the repository `awslabs/smithy` to use CodeGuru Reviewer.

## Deploy the Stack to your account

Once you have updated the `allowedGithubRepos`, run the following commands:
```
npx cdk bootstrap aws://unknown-account/unknown-region
npx cdk deploy
```
(You only need to bootstrap once.) If you use a named profile, run `npx cdk deploy --profile {PROFILE-NAME}` instead. After the deployment completes, you will receive an output like this:

```
 âœ…  GuruCdkSetupStack

Outputs:
GuruCdkSetupStack.Role = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionRole
GuruCdkSetupStack.Region = us-east-1
GuruCdkSetupStack.Bucket = codeguru-reviewer-build-artifacts-123456789012-us-east-1
```

## Add the Action to your GitHub repositories

You can use the following template for your Action:

```
# Add this file to your .github/workflows directory
name: Analyze with CodeGuru Reviewer
on: [push]
permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read
    security-events: write 

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      continue-on-error: true
      id: iam-role
      with:
        role-to-assume: {ROLE_ARN}
        aws-region: {REGION}
    
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      if: steps.iam-role.outcome == 'success'
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

# Add your build instructions here. E.g., setup java and run a Gralde build as follows:
#    - name: Set up JDK 1.8
#      if: steps.iam-role.outcome == 'success'
#      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
#      with:
#        java-version: 1.8
#    - name: Build gradle package
#      if: steps.iam-role.outcome == 'success'
#      run: ./gradlew build -x test

    - name: CodeGuru Reviewer
      if: steps.iam-role.outcome == 'success'
      uses: aws-actions/codeguru-reviewer@v1.1
      continue-on-error: false
      with:          
        s3_bucket: {BUCKET_NAME}
# Set a build directory where your build system put the jar/class files if you 
# want security findings for Java. For Gradle, the default build path is:
#        build_path: ./build/libs 

    # This upload the recommendations into GitHub's Security Tab. Before you can start using
    # this feature you need to set up GitHub Code Scanning for your repository:
    # https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository
    - name: Upload review result
      if: steps.iam-role.outcome == 'success'
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
      with:
        sarif_file: codeguru-results.sarif.json
```

Replace the strings `{ROLE_ARN}`, `{REGION}`, and `{BUCKET_NAME}` with the values that you received as output from CDK.

This example uses GitHub's Code Scanning feature to display the recommendations. **If you are using a private repository without paying for Code Scanning, this will fail**. Before you
can use this feature, you need to enable GitHub Code Scanning for your repository or organization (see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository)).
If you are not planning on using this feature, omit the `Upload review result` part.

You can also see all recommendations in you AWS Console.

For Java, you should also add build instructions before the CodeGuru step and set the build folder in the CodeGuru Action to receive security recommendations.

For more information, see the [CodeGuru Reviewer documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/working-with-cicd.html).

Note that only allow-listed organizations and repositories can assume the IAM Role to run CodeGuru Reviewer.
For this reason, we recommend that you run the CodeGuru Reviewer Action only on `push` events. The action will
only succeed on `pull_requests` if the repository from which the `pull_request` originated is also part of the
allow list.

Further, to avoid failures of the Action for users who fork this repository, we label the Role assumption step
with `id: iam-role` and guard all other workflow steps with:
```
if: steps.iam-role.outcome == 'success'
```
so they do not get executed if the fork is not allowed to assume the Role.
